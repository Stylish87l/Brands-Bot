## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running

This project is designed to be run in an environment where the Google Gemini API key is securely managed as an environment variable.

1.  **API Key**:
    - The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.
    - It is configured to read the key from `process.env.API_KEY`.
    - You must set this environment variable in your development environment (e.g., via a `.env` file if using a local server, or as a secret in a cloud environment).

2.  **Installation**:
    - No `npm install` is required for dependencies, as they are loaded via an `importmap` from a CDN.

3.  **Running**:
    - Serve the `index.html` file using any static file server.
    - Open the provided URL in your browser. The application will start immediately.

## ü§ñ How It Works

1.  **Input**: The user provides brand assets (name, logo, colors, etc.) and campaign details (product photo, description, target platforms) through the sidebar.
2.  **AI Services**: When the "Generate Campaign" button is clicked, the application makes calls to the `geminiService.ts`.
3.  **Prompt Engineering**: The service dynamically constructs detailed prompts for each selected platform, combining the user's text inputs and image files into a multi-modal request for the Gemini API.
4.  **API Calls**: It calls the appropriate Gemini models for each task (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for images, `veo-2.0-generate-001` for video). Video generation involves an asynchronous polling mechanism to check for completion.
5.  **Results**: The generated images (as base64 data URLs) and videos (as blob URLs) are returned to the main `App` component.
6.  **Display**: The `ResultsDisplay` component renders the final creatives in a grid, allowing the user to view and download their new ad campaign.
