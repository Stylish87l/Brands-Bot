## üöÄ Getting Started & Deployment

This project is designed for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

1.  **Fork and Clone**: Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Vercel Project**: Create a new project on Vercel and link it to your forked GitHub repository.
3.  **API Key**:
    - The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.
    - In your Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables".
    - Add a new environment variable named `API_KEY` and paste your Google Gemini API key as the value.
4.  **Deployment**:
    - Vercel will automatically detect the project setup. When you push to your repository's main branch, Vercel will trigger a deployment.
    - During the build, Vercel will run `npm install` to install the backend dependencies listed in `package.json` and deploy the serverless function from the `/api` directory.
    - The frontend will be served as a static site.
5.  **Local Development (Optional)**:
    - Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
    - Run `vercel dev` in the project root. The Vercel CLI will replicate the cloud environment, including handling the serverless function and environment variables (which you can define in a local `.env.local` file).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Backend**: [Vercel Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) (Node.js)

- **Frontend Dependencies**: Loaded via ES Modules `importmap` from a CDN.
- **Backend Dependencies**: Managed via `package.json`.

## ü§ñ Technical Overview

1.  **Frontend**: The user interacts with a React single-page application. All UI logic is handled client-side (`ControlsSidebar.tsx`, `App.tsx`).
2.  **API Proxy**: Instead of calling the Google Gemini API directly from the browser, the frontend sends requests to a secure serverless function at `/api/gemini` (`services/geminiService.ts`).
3.  **Backend (Serverless Function)**: The Vercel function in `api/gemini.ts` receives requests from the frontend. It securely accesses the `API_KEY` from environment variables, initializes the `@google/genai` SDK, and forwards the request to the appropriate Google Gemini API model.
4.  **Prompt Engineering**: The backend function dynamically constructs detailed, multi-modal prompts for each selected platform. It combines the user's text inputs and image files (received as base64) into structured requests for the Gemini API.
5.  **Response Handling**: The generated images (as base64 data URLs) and videos (fetched from a temporary URI and returned as base64) are sent from the serverless function back to the `App.tsx` component.
6.  **Display**: The `ResultsDisplay.tsx` component renders the final creatives in a responsive grid, allowing the user to view and download their new ad campaign assets.
